# Visual Studio Code - Windows 7, 8 & 8.1 backport
This isn't really a fancy readme but I don't give a shit

## How to remake this yourself:

### 1. Compile VSCode or get it from the official site
Doesn't matter really, all that matters is you get VSCode from somewhere

### 2. Get supermium-electron (shoutout to win32)
Supermium-electron is backported electron 28, you can find it here >>> https://github.com/win32ss/supermium-electron/releases/tag/v28-testing

## Now that you have everything you need, you can porting!

### 3. Now, replace the incompatible binaries with win32's supermium-electron binaries

### 4. That's it!

You're done, this is what the finished product should look like
